As a new member of the EMPEX organizing committee, I'm excited to be spreading the word about [EMPEX NCY 2019](http://empex.co/nyc.html) to our Elixir School readers!

EMPEX is a sophisticated conference series for functional programming languages and ecosystems held in New York City. We present a single track of technical talks in a jazz club. Our goal is to bring a sense of aesthetic and fun to the growing functional community.

Elixir School contributors work hard to provide a robust, living resource for the growing community of Elixir devs. Come see that community in action this May--meet other Elixir devs, learn about the direction the language is growing in and get inspired by our speakers.

Our [CFP is open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-XF7U2E9ztKovfKpGDlwCCx2mLvpVCuQJiDYrM160Y7a6gg/viewform?usp=send_form), so submit your talk idea for consideration. Or consider joining one of the [training courses that will be held ahead of the conference on May 17th](http://empex.co/nyc.html#training). Learn how to craft and deploy bulletproof embedded software with Elixir and Nerves. Or, if you're new to Elixir, check out our Crash Course in Elixir, for (Ruby, Java, JS, etc) Developers.

Hope to see you there!
